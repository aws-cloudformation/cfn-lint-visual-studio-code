For example, the filter ``ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us`` matches findings with a ``ResourceRegion`` that starts with a value other than ``us``.\n  \n  ``NOT_CONTAINS``, ``NOT_EQUALS``, and ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS`` filters on the same field are joined by ``AND``. A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters ``Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch`` match a finding that excludes both ``CloudFront`` and ``CloudWatch`` in the title.\n You can\u2019t have both a ``CONTAINS`` filter and a ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can't provide both an ``EQUALS`` filter and a ``NOT_EQUALS`` or ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS`` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. ``CONTAINS`` filters can only be used with other ``CONTAINS`` filters. ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filters can only be used with other ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filters. \n You can combine ``PREFIX`` filters with ``NOT_EQUALS`` or ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS`` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the ``PREFIX`` filters, and then the ``NOT_EQUALS`` or ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS`` filters.\n For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either ``AwsIam`` or ``AwsEc2``. It then excludes findings that have a resource type of ``AwsIamPolicy`` and findings that have a resource type of ``AwsEc2NetworkInterface``.\n  +   ``ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`` \n  +   ``ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`` \n  +   ``ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`` \n  +   ``ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`` \n  \n  ``CONTAINS`` and ``NOT_CONTAINS`` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *User Guide*.\n\n---\n\nRequired: Yes  \nType:   \nUpdate requires: No interruption"
