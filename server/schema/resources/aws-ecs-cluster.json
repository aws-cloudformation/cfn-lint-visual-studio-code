New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCapacityProvider.html) API operation.\n To use a FARGATElong capacity provider, specify either the ``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` capacity providers. The FARGATElong capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.\n The [PutCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutCapacityProvider.html) API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.\n\n---\n\nRequired: No  \nType: Array  \nUpdate requires: No interruption"
